INFO: global testapp
  NOTE! never move subsuit of tests into "mainexe/test"
    * each component must have only unit-tests related to sources placed in that component
    * each integration test suit of multiple components must be separate component itself
      NICE: in this way you can create tests on integration test suit itself :)

  [_] MAYBE: move example* and BaseTest* into ./common/ or ./cfg/
    => so only ./test-* scripts will be in ./testing/ dir
