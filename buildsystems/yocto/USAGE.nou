Fast rebuild / change sources
  * run "bitbake" only once -- to generate scripts
  * no need to run "source env/oe-template" in new terminals
    ALSO: these vars only needed for scripts generation, not for building:
      ~~ TEMPLATECONF BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE BBPATH BUILDDIR
  * scripts !run.do_compile contains full env
