%%%% Structure

Each language directory
  :/doc/    | gathered docs
  :/embed/  | boilerplate to embed its runtime into other languages
  :/ex/     | evolutionary usage examples
  :/tmpl/   | refined partial boilerplates to simply copy when needed


DEV: language incremental templates
  E.G. bash:
    - micro (one-two lines)
    - small         +vars
    - normal        +functions
    - large         +getopts
    - full-pledged  +auto-help
