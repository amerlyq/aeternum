LocalStorage problems

! Seems like onresize is called after each onload
! Don't use window.onbeforeunload = storePos(), it seems to store 0

> Events
  window.onload
    On each refresh of page
  window.onbeforeunload
    On refresh page by pressing F5, close tab or browser, enter a new url and <Enter>

Seems like onResize is called only after rotating screen!
  ```js
  function onResizePost() { loadPos(); }
  if (this.resizeTimeout) { clearTimeout(this.resizeTimeout); }
  storePos();
  this.resizeTimeout = setTimeout(onResizePost, 500);
  ```
