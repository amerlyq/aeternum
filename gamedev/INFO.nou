  GLFW

    If graphics only (getting a GL context going) and basic input
      support is what you need, then GLFW3 is the best alternative imo.
    Super clean and easy to use.
    Nice documentation as well.
    For making demos and similar, nothing beats GLFW3.
    GLFW: Light weight, callback system, decent support, good GLES support.

  SFML
    https://www.sfml-dev.org/
      https://github.com/SFML/SFML
    is pretty great if you're using C++
    Very clean and well designed C++ api.
    If you're the kind of person who would use SDL or GLFW
      and wrap everything with RAII types before getting started -- just use SFML instead.
    -- does not allow you to allocate a core context
